# DigitalDocs
The project focuses on the Android application for digitizing paper documents. Using Android system support. An ECR (Electronic cash register) segment of the application will be programmed to contact another application, in this case a payment application on the same device. Our application will receive card and account information from the payment application. After the payment application prints the invoice / slip, the user will be able to take a picture of the slip / invoice and will connect with the data obtained from the payment application. Such a set of data will be sent to the Web server, which will assign the user his account according to the card number from the request as a guarantee confirmation.

Users will only be able to see their stored digital documents on the Website.
The device uses Android and Java, while the Web server uses Spring Boot as a backend and React.js as a frontend application, the database will use PostgreSQL and file system support.

A four member team collaborated on the application, whose members are students of the Faculty of Organization and Informatics in Varaždin, with the help of mentor Doc. dr. sc. Zlatko Stapić and Karlo Magdić from SedamIT.
